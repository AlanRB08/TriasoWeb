    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-5">Triaso manufacturers directly, we don´t have subcontractors</h2>
    <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-5">No other asphalt plant manufacturer produces as many components 
        for its own equipment as we do. Unlike others, <strong>we manufacture 
        directly without subcontractors</strong>, ensuring that every part meets 
        our strict quality standards.
        This approach enables us to deliver <strong>superior service, warranty,
         and direct support</strong> from both our manufacturing plant in Mexico 
         and USA. Unlike most brands, which produce only a few components
          and rely heavily on external suppliers, we manufacture and 
          assemble our equipment in-house.</p>

            <p>At Triaso, you work directly with the manufacturer—no intermediaries or external sellers.
                 We design and produce our equipment, guaranteeing top quality, competitive pricing, and 
                 personalized service. Our in-house manufacturing ensures unparalleled warranty coverage, 
                 rapid support, immediate spare parts availability, and customized solutions tailored to your
