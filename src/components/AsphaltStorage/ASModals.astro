Once heated, the asphalt is easily —where the hose is—since at high temperatures, asphalt behaves like water. To prevent blockages inside the pipe, the pump operates in both directions: forward and reverse. When the tank finishes operating, the pump draws the asphalt from the outlet hose back into the tank.

          Equipped with high-efficiency internal coils and industrial-grade
          insulation, these tanks retain heat effectively, reduce energy
          consumption, and maintain stable asphalt temperatures — even in
          extreme climates.

        <p>
          Each tank includes OSHA-compliant safety features such as a caged
          ladder, top manhole access, anti-slip diamond-plate decking,
          full-perimeter handrails, and kickplates to ensure safe operation and
          maintenance access.

        <p>
          At ground level, all valves, gauges, and connections are easily
          accessible, allowing fast, safe loading and unloading, as well as
          convenient temperature monitoring.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Standard models include a digital temperature controller, and
          configurations can be customized with mixers, level indicators, vapor
          condensers, and other accessories to meet the requirements of each
