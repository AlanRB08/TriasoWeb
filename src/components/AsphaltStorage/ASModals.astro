                              operating, the pump sends the asphalt from the outlet hose back into the tank.

              Equipped with high-efficiency internal coils and thick industrial-grade insulation, these tanks
               effectively retain heat, reduce energy consumption, and maintain a consistent product temperature, 
               even in extreme climates. Optional electric heaters can be added to meet specific operational needs

              Each tank includes OSHA-compliant safety features such as a caged ladder, top manhole access, anti-slip
               diamond-plate deck, full perimeter handrails, and kickplates to ensure safe operation and maintenance access.
            </p><br>

              At ground level, all valves, gauges, and connections are easily accessible, making loading, unloading,
               and temperature monitoring fast and secure. Standard models include a digital temperature controller,
                and configurations can be customized with mixers, level indicators, vapor condensers, and other accessories
                 to match the demands of your application.
