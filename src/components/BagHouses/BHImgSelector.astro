                        <p>
                            In venturi-based filtration systems, the airflow
                            design introduces multiple inefficiencies that
                            affect both dust collection and system durability.
                            The high-speed airflow exiting the venturi creates a
                            low-pressure zone at the upper section of the filter
                            bag, pulling dust toward that area. This causes
                            uneven accumulation and reduces filtration capacity.
                            Over time, fine particles become embedded deep
                            within the fabric, making cleaning less effective.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            Another issue is the placement of the cleaning air
                            pulse near the bag opening. This location limits its
                            ability to draw in additional air that could improve
                            dust removal. Meanwhile, the narrow venturi forces
                            filtered air to accelerate rapidly into the plenum,
                            creating upward airflow that resists the cleaning
                            pulse. As a result, stronger air blasts are needed,
                            increasing energy use and putting mechanical stress
                            on the bags—leading to faster wear and reduced
                            lifespan.

                            The new series baghouse improves dust removal by
                            completely redesigning the airflow process. Instead
                            of relying on a traditional venturi system, it uses
                            a supersonic converging-diverging nozzle to generate
                            the cleaning air jet. This shift in design allows
                            for the induction of more secondary air, enhancing
                            the cleaning efficiency. The removal of the venturi
                            also reduces the throat velocity at the bag’s inlet,
                            preventing the negative pressure that typically
                            leads to dust buildup at the top of the filter bag.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            By fully utlization of the bag mouth, the cleaning
                            air jet expands evenly, minimizing the likelihood of
                            dust cake blowout. Leading to a more uniform bag
                            inflation, resulting in a more effective cleaning
                            cycle and reduced wear on the fabric. As a result,
                            the Triaso Model only requires half the filter area
                            compared to traditional venturi systems, enabling
                            Triaso to offer high performance in a more compact
                            form.

                The Triaso Extractor is designed to effectively manage airflow
                and ensure optimal gas filtration in the asphalt plant. With its
                curved blade fan, the extractor pulls gases through the system
                while maintaining efficient air circulation. By keeping external
                contaminants out, it helps maintain internal pressure at the
                necessary levels for consistent operation.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                It operates using centrifugal force to separate dust from
                exhaust gases. As the gas enters, it spirals along the inner
                walls, where heavier particles are pushed outward. Approximately
                70% of the total dust load falls to the bottom for collection,
                reducing the burden on the baghouse filters, improving
                efficiency, and extending their service life.

            The finer dust particles are directed into the baghouse through a
            strategically placed high side inlet. This ensures horizontal and
            downward airflow, preventing fine dust from being re-entrained into
            the system. A knockout chamber decelerates airflow, allowing more
            material to drop into the hopper, while internal baffles ensure even
            air distribution and protect the bags from abrasion.

            This design optimizes air quality, enhances filtration efficiency,

                    Our bin units are built with wear-resistant materials
                    designed to handle abrasive and heavy loads. This durable
                    construction ensures reliable performance under demanding
                    conditions. By reducing wear and minimizing maintenance
                    needs, the design extends service life and provides
                    consistent, long-term operation.

                    The dosing system provides flexible control to meet the
                    specific requirements of each project. With options for both
                    manual and automatic adjustment, it allows precise
                    regulation of material flow. This versatility ensures
                    efficient handling of materials ranging from fine aggregates
                    to coarse components, allowing smooth integration into any
                    production setup.

                    After the baghouse collects fine particles in the hoppers, a
                    screw conveyor transfers them back to the drum mixer. The
                    return point is precisely timed and located at the liquid
                    asphalt injection zone, ensuring the fines are immediately
                    coated and fully incorporated into the hot-mix.

                    By reintegrating the fines at this specific point, the
                    system prevents them from becoming airborne again, reduces
                    material loss, and improves the quality and durability of
                    the asphalt. This efficient recovery not only enhances
                    environmental performance but also maximizes resource use
                    for a more cost-effective operation.
