                    <p>
                        In venturi-based filtration systems, the airflow design introduces multiple inefficiencies
                         that affect both dust collection and system durability. The high-speed airflow exiting the
                          venturi creates a low-pressure zone at the upper section of the filter bag, pulling dust toward 
                          that area. This causes uneven accumulation and reduces filtration capacity. Over time, fine particles 
                          become embedded deep within the fabric, making cleaning less effective.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Another issue is the placement of the cleaning air pulse near the bag opening. This location limits
                         its ability to draw in additional air that could improve dust removal. Meanwhile, the narrow venturi
                          forces filtered air to accelerate rapidly into the plenum, creating upward airflow that resists the
                          cleaning pulse. As a result, stronger air blasts are needed, increasing energy use and putting mechanical
                           stress on the bags—leading to faster wear and reduced lifespan.

                    <p>
                        The new series baghouse improves dust removal by completely redesigning the airflow process. 
                        Instead of relying on a traditional venturi system, it uses a supersonic converging-diverging 
                        nozzle to generate the cleaning air jet. This shift in design allows for the induction of more 
                        secondary air, enhancing the cleaning efficiency. The removal of the venturi also reduces the throat
                        velocity at the bag’s inlet, preventing the negative pressure that typically leads to dust buildup at
                         the top of the filter bag.

                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        By fully utlization of the bag mouth, the cleaning air jet expands evenly, minimizing the likelihood 
                        of dust cake blowout. Leading to a more uniform bag inflation, resulting in a more effective cleaning
                         cycle and reduced wear on the fabric. As a result, the Triaso Model only requires half the filter area
                          compared to traditional venturi systems, enabling Triaso to offer high performance in a more compact form.

            The gas stream enters the baghouse’s inlet chamber after passing through the primary dust collector.

                The Triaso Extractor is designed to effectively manage airflow and ensure optimal gas filtration in the asphalt plant. 
                With its curved blade fan, the extractor pulls gases through the system while maintaining efficient air circulation. By

                It operates using centrifugal force to separate dust from exhaust gases. As the gas enters, it spirals along the inner walls, 
                where heavier particles are pushed outward. Approximately 70% of the total dust load falls to the bottom for collection, reducing 
                the burden on the baghouse filters, improving efficiency, and extending their service life.

            The finer dust particles are directed into the baghouse through a strategically placed high side inlet. This ensures horizontal
