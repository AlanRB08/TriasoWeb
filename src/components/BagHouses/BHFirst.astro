            Triaso® baghouses are designed for efficient dust collection and
            air quality control in industrial applications. Engineered for
            maximum filtration efficiency, they capture fine particulates ensure
            compliance with environmental regulations while enhancing workplace
            safety. Designed for asphalt plants and aggregate processing, these
            self-contained and integrated systems offer durable,
            high-performance air filtration. With advanced cleaning mechanisms
            and high air-to-cloth ratios, Triaso® baghouses improve mix
            performance by enabling the controlled reincorporation of fine
            particles into the mix and support sustainable operation by reducing
            airborne dust and emissions.
