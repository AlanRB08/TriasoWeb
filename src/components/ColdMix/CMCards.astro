        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl">What is a Cold Mix Plant?</h2><br>
        <p class="text-grisP">Cold mix asphalt plants are designed for blending aggregates and asphalt emulsions 
            at ambient temperatures, eliminating the need for heating. Using a pugmill mixer, 
            they ensure a uniform, high-quality mix ideal for a wide range of road maintenance 
            and construction applications.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl">Precision Dosing for Reliable Results</h2><br>
        <p class="text-grisP">Equipped with material hoppers and adjustable gates, 
            cold mix plants provide precise control over aggregate dosing. This accuracy allows 
            for consistent mix quality and repeatable results, even when using different material 
            types or gradations.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl">Eco-Friendly Asphalt Solutions</h2><br>
        <p class="text-grisP">Cold mix technology uses lower temperatures and fewer emissions
             compared to traditional hot mix plants. This makes them a more environmentally 
             conscious choice, particularly in areas with strict emissions regulations or 
             urban work zones.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl">Low Operating Costs</h2><br>
        <p class="text-grisP">Without the need for burners or thermal oil systems, cold mix plants
             offer significantly reduced fuel and maintenance expenses. Their simple mechanical 
             systems also mean less downtime and faster return on investment for municipalities
              and contractors alike.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl">Built for Mobility and Easy Setup</h2><br>
        <p class="text-grisP">Compact and mobile configurations make cold mix plants easy to 
            transport and set up on any site. With minimal installation requirements, they’re 
            ideal for short-term jobs or shifting from site to site quickly and efficiently.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl">On-Demand Asphalt Production</h2><br>
        <p class="text-grisP">Cold mix plants offer the flexibility to produce asphalt on-site and 
            as needed, reducing reliance on external suppliers. This minimizes delays and ensures
             the mix is always fresh and ready to use, especially valuable in remote locations or
