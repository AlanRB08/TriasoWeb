            <p class="text-grisP">
              Cold mix asphalt plants are designed to blend  aggregates and liquid emulsions at ambient temperature,
               eliminating the need for heating. Using a pugmill mixer, they produce a uniform, durable mix suitable 
               for a wide range of road maintenance and construction projects.

              Cold mix asphalt plants are designed according to the user's discharge height requirements, with the option
               of ground-level discharge for needed projects, or elevated discharge for direct loading into trucks for
                bulk applications.
