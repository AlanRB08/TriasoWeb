                Triaso® cold mix plants are specifically engineered to produce aggregate mixtures without applying heat.
                Using a robust pugmill mixer, these plants blend unheated aggregates with asphalt emulsion or other
                liquid binders to deliver a uniform, durable mix suitable for a variety of applications.
                <br><br>
                Equipped with precision dosing hoppers, they ensure accurate control of material proportions, providing
                consistent performance across every batch. Their capability to handle different aggregate types makes
                them well-suited for patching, road maintenance, and small-scale paving applications.
