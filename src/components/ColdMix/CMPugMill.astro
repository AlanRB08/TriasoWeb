                The pugmill is a crucial component in cold mix plants, designed to
                 effectively blend a variety of materials, including aggregates, to create a 
                 uniform mix. Its durable construction ensures smooth operation and reliable 
                 performance over time. <br><br>
                 The pugmill’s efficient mixing process allows for precise control, making it 
                 suitable for a wide range of applications where consistent material quality is 
                 required. With easy maintenance and operation, the pugmill provides long-lasting 
                 performance in various industrial environments.

            <p class="text-grisP">
                The mixing paddles inside the pugmill are essential for achieving a uniform, 
                high-quality asphalt blend. Strategically arranged along twin synchronized shafts 
                driven by a gear system, they ensure thorough blending of all components, preventing
                material build-up and promoting even distribution of asphalt emulsion. <br><br>

                Made from wear-resistant materials such as Hardox steel or cast iron, the paddles
                are fully interchangeable and designed to endure heavy use and abrasive aggregates without
                losing efficiency. An internal protective layer forms during operation, minimizing direct 
                wear on the structure and significantly extending the service life of the equipment. <br><br>
                
                Easy to maintain and built for durability, the pugmill guarantees consistent mixing 
                performance even under the most demanding conditions.

            The pugmill features twin synchronized shafts driven by a gear system for balanced,
             efficient mixing. Its cast iron mixer pads are fully interchangeable and built for
              durability. An internal protective layer forms during operation, reducing direct wear 
              on the structure and extending the plant’s service life.
