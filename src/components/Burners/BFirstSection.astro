        <p class="text-base md:text-lg">Triaso® 'Total Air' Burners are designed for complete and efficient fuel combustion, using a fully sealed system that doesn’t
             rely on the drum’s exhaust. This avoids pollution, mix contamination, and filter clogging—while saving fuel and maintaining
              consistent performance throughout the day. Their precise air control system ensures clean operation, low emissions, and reliable 
              results in any climate.
