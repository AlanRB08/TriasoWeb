                <p>These burners provide only 30% to 45% of the necessary combustion air (called primary air) through the blower.</p>
                <p>The remaining air (secondary air) is drawn in by the chimney's suction system, entering freely through openings in the drum's front shield.</p>
                <p>Because this secondary air is not preheated or regulated, a larger volume must be heated, leading to higher fuel consumption.</p>

                <p>These burners supply 100% of the air required for combustion through their own blower, in a controlled manner.</p>
                <p>As a result, no additional air entries are needed in the drum, and the air volume is precisely calculated for combustion needs.</p>
                <p>Since all the air entering the drum is regulated by the burner, it ensures an efficient carburetion process that makes use of 100% of the fuel.</p>
                <p>Total air burners are typically only offered by top-tier brands due to their advanced technology and high cost. However, since 2014, Triaso includes total air burners
                     in all its parallel flow (Basic and Plus) and counterflow drums as standard equipment with no extra charge.
