            Triaso® Fuel Preheaters are engineered to improve combustion efficiency by reducing the viscosity of 
            low-cost fuels before burning. By preheating the fuel, proper atomization is achieved, eliminating unburned droplets that can 
            contaminate the mix, clog filters, or cause excess smoke. This system ensures cleaner combustion, lower emissions, and consistent 
            performance—while protecting your asphalt quality and reducing fuel consumption in any working condition.
