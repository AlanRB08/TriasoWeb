            Triaso® Fuel Preheaters are engineered to improve combustion efficiency by 
            reducing the viscosity of any kind of fuels before ignition. By preheating the fuel, proper atomization
             is achieved, eliminating unburned droplets that could contaminate the mix, clog filters, or 
             cause excess smoke. This system ensures cleaner combustion, lower emissions, and consistent 
             performance—while protecting your asphalt quality and reducing fuel consumption under any working
              condition.
