            Modern asphalt plant burners are specifically designed for low-viscosity fuels. Diesel, being low in viscosity, 
            burns efficiently but comes at a high cost. In contrast, the lower the cost of the fuel, the higher its viscosity tends to 
            be—making it more difficult to burn effectively.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-base md:text-lg">
            To efficiently burn low-cost fuels, it is necessary to heat them before combustion in order to reduce their viscosity—a process known 
            as preheating. Without preheating, fuel atomization becomes inefficient, resulting in many unburned microdroplets and incomplete
             combustion. This is especially important because the cheaper the fuel, the more difficult it is to burn properly.
