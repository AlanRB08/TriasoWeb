            RAP (Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement) is the asphalt pavement recovered
            through milling. It is fully suitable for recycling by incorporating
            it into new asphalt mixes, taking advantage of both its aggregates
            and the asphalt binder it contains. Recycling this highly wasted
            material significantly reduces production costs by lowering material
            and binder consumption, minimizing transportation costs, saving
            energy, and—most importantly—achieving substantial economic gains
            through reduced life-cycle costs..
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm font-medium">
            RAP ha been utilized in hot-mixes since 1915, enabling significant
            cost savings in the asphalt mix where it is utilized. An asphalt mix
            with RAP incorporated has a much lower production cost compared to
            one without RAP—mainly from the reuse of the asphalt binder already
            present in the RAP. This is why RAP usage has been growing rapidly
            in recent years on a global scale.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm font-medium">
            We offer everything you need to work with RAP, from modifications to
            your existing asphalt plant to a new plant specialized in
            cost-effective RAP production.

                The RAP must be introduced at a point in the drum where it does

                asphalt it contains does not burn and become unusable.

                        At TRIASO, we introduce the RAP through a collar located

                        on, the RAP never touches the burner flame and is heated

                        From this point on, the material never comes into direct
